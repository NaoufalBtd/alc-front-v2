  "Developers": "Young people who are passionate about achieving their goals to move our region forward by leveraging cutting-edge technology in the motive of simplifying and enhancing learning.\n",
  "wheredid": "The name indicates itself, EngFlexy is a compound word of two words Eng and Flexy.\nEng is an acronym for English, and Flexy is an acronym for flexible.\nThe basic idea here is that our platform must be far away from the traditional language centers (a building with teachers + stacked departments + a blackboard), using advanced technology. In fact, we have developed an interactive platform that is 100% online flexible, that means, the learner is the one who chooses the appropriate time and place for him. Moreover, there is the possibility to choose between individual or group classes\n",

IT AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT.\nSubject to restrictions and prohibitions in applicable law, you and EngFlexy mutually agree to resolve any and all covered justiciable disputes between you exclusively through final and binding arbitration instead of a court or jury trial. Except as explicitly stated otherwise in this Arbitration and Class Action Waiver section, this arbitration agreement requires the arbitration of any claims that EngFlexy or you may have against the other or against any of their: \nofficers, directors, employees, subcontractors, or agents in their capacity as such or otherwise,\ndirect or indirect parents and subsidiaries, and\naffiliates, agents, successors or assigns,\nInitial Dispute Resolution: Most disputes can be resolved without resort to litigation. You can reach EngFlexy‚Äôs support department at help@engflexy.com. Except for intellectual property and small claims court claims, the parties agree to use their best efforts to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement directly through consultation with the EngFlexy support department, and good faith negotiations shall be a condition to either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration. \nDemand for Arbitration. If the parties do not reach an agreed-upon solution within a period of thirty (30) days from the time informal dispute resolution is initiated under the Initial Dispute Resolution provision above, then either party may initiate binding arbitration as the sole means to resolve claims, subject to the terms set forth below. If either party initiates arbitration, the initiating party must notify the other party in writing via  email, or hand delivery within the applicable statute of limitations period. This demand for arbitration must include: (i) the name and address of the party seeking arbitration; (ii) a statement of the legal and factual basis of the claim; and (iii) a description of the remedy sought. The Arbitrator will resolve all disputes regarding the timeliness or propriety of the demand for arbitration. The parties understand that, absent this mandatory arbitration provision, they would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial. They further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.       \nClass and Collective Action Waivers. You and EngFlexy mutually agree that by entering into this arbitration agreement to arbitrate, both waive their right to have any covered dispute or claim brought, heard or arbitrated as a class action and/or collective action, and an Arbitrator will not have any authority to hear or arbitrate any class and/or collective claim (‚ÄúClass Action Waiver‚Äù). Notwithstanding any other clause contained in this arbitration agreement, as defined below, any claim that all or part of this Class Action Waiver is unenforceable, unconscionable, void, or voidable may be determined only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an Arbitrator. The Class Action Waiver will be severable from this arbitration agreement in any case, in which (1) the dispute is filed as a class and/or collective action and (2) there is a final judicial determination that all or part of the Class Action Waiver is invalid, unenforceable, unconscionable, void, or voidable. In such case, the class and/or collective action to that extent must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction, but the portion of the Class Action Waiver that is enforceable shall be enforced in arbitration.  \nException: Litigation of Intellectual Property and Small Claims Court Claims. Notwithstanding the parties' decision to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either party may bring enforcement actions, validity determinations or claims arising from or relating to theft, piracy or unauthorized use of intellectual property in Morocco  court or to protect its intellectual property rights (\"intellectual property rights\" means patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets, but not privacy or publicity rights). Either party may also seek relief in a small claims court for disputes or claims within the scope of that court's jurisdiction.\n30-Day Right to Opt Out. Unless you have previously agreed to an arbitration and class action waiver provision for disputes with EngFlexy, you have the right to opt out and not be bound by the arbitration and class action waiver provisions set forth above by sending (from the email address you used to register for your account) written notice of your decision to opt out to help@engflexy.com with the subject line, \"ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER OPT-OUT.\" The notice must be sent within thirty (30) days of your first use of the Platform or the effective date of the first Agreement containing an Arbitration and Class Action Waiver section, whichever is later; otherwise, you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms of these paragraphs. If you opt out of these arbitration provisions, EngFlexy also will not be bound by them.\nChanges to This Section. EngFlexy will provide thirty (30) days' notice of any changes affecting the substance of this section by posting on the Platform, sending you a message, or otherwise notifying you when you are logged into your account. Amendments affecting the substance of this section will become effective thirty (30) days after they are posted on the Platform or sent to you. Changes to this section will otherwise apply prospectively only to claims arising after the thirtieth (30th) day. If a court or arbitrator decides that this subsection on \"Changes to This Section\" is not enforceable or valid, then this subsection shall be severed from the section entitled ‚ÄúArbitration and Class Action Waiver,‚Äù and the court or arbitrator shall apply the first Arbitration and Class Action Waiver section in existence after you began using the Platform.\nSurvival.
